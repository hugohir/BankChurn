# Context

Thera Bank has seen a steep decline in the number of users of its credit cards. Like other banks, credit cards are also a good source of income for Thera Bank because they generate revenue by collecting annual fees, balance transfer fees, cash advance fees, late payment fees, foreign transaction fees, and others.

When a credit card customer leaves, the bank will lose that revenue source, so it is very important that the bank implements measures to avoid losing those customers.

To achieve this, we will implement a classification model that will help Thera Bank improve its services so credit card customers do not leave the service.

Finally, we will generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the bank reduce credit card customer churn.
